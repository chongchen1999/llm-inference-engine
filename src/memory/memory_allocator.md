Hereâ€™s a rewritten and organized version of the allocator descriptions to improve clarity and readability:

### Allocator Design Goals

**Objective:**  
- Reduce the frequency of `malloc` and `free` calls
- Minimize memory fragmentation

### Our Allocator

1. **Block**: 
   - Attributes: `ptr`, `size`, `is_allocated`

2. **Blockpool**: 
   - Structure: `map<int, vector<Block>>`

3. **UnifyMalloc**: 
   - **Pools**:
     - `bigBlockPool` for large buffers
     - `smallBlockPool` for small buffers
   - **Allocation Process**:
     - Search for the buffer in the appropriate pool (`block vector`)
     - If not found, use `cudaMalloc`

4. **UnifyFree**:
   - **Deallocation Process**:
     - Check if the pointer is in the `blockPool`:
       - Set `is_allocated` to `false`
       - Do not return to the OS
     - If not found in `blockPool`, use `cudaFree`
   - **Memory Fragmentation**:
     - Implement strategies to clear memory fragments

### PyTorch Allocator

1. **Block**:
   - Attributes: `ptr`, `size`, `is_allocated`, `prev`, `next`
   - Structure: Doubly linked list

2. **Blockpool**:
   - Structure: `set<Block>`

3. **Malloc Process**:
   - Search for the buffer in the `Blockpool` (`set`)
   - If not found:
     - Attempt to merge free blocks into a larger block
     - If merging is unsuccessful:
       - Release free blocks and try to find a suitable block
     - If no suitable block is found:
       - Split a large block to clean up memory fragments
     - If still not successful, use `cudaMalloc`

### TensorFlow BFC Allocator

1. **Block**:
   - Attributes: Similar to PyTorch, but with a focus on Buddy Allocator.

2. **Buddy Allocator**:
   - Allocates and manages memory in a buddy system to reduce fragmentation.
   - **Details**: Specific mechanisms for splitting and merging blocks.

3. **Other Allocators**:
   - The TensorFlow BFC allocator uses variations of the buddy allocator and additional strategies for memory management.

This structured approach outlines the key features and strategies of each allocator, emphasizing the process and techniques used to handle memory allocation and deallocation efficiently.
